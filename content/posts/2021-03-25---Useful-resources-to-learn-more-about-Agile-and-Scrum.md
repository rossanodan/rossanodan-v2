If you work into software development - if you don't, I have no idea how you ended up here - and especially in medium/big sized companies, you surely heard about **Agile** and **Scrum**. So probably you don't need what follows.

For all the others instead, here's a list of useful links where you can read about Agile, Scrum, Scrum roles and sprint ceremonies.

- https://www.atlassian.com/agile - if you don't know what Agile is, please read this first
- https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum - Scrum framework. Here you can learn all about Scrum (sprints, agile ceremonies, standup, roles, etc)
- https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html - twelve general principles of the Agile Manifesto
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TycLR0TqFA - Short but very useful video about Scrum

You can thank me later.
